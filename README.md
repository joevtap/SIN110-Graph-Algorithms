## 🪜 Introduction

As said above, this repository contains all the code written for completion of homeworks and projects during my Graph Algorithms course at UNIFEI. Everything you see here is going to be revised by Professor Frinhani, so keep that in mind and (please) don't copy it!  

That said, this repository will also contain personal projects that correlate with the subject; those can be tracked in other branches, but I'll keep it clear as I develop then.
